Its that time of the year again, the leaves are changing color and the nights are getting longer. So why not spend that
extra time inside writing some code. It's time for Hacktoberfest!

If you have not heard of this before its an event hosted my Digital Ocean every October to help encourage people to
contribute to open source projects. This is a great opportunity to get started in the world of OSS or even if you are
a long time contributor a good way to find new projects to work on or even get interest for a project you are working on.

I have taken part for the last two years and its been a great way to find new projects in the OSS space and get more
exposure to public code. If you have never opened a pull request this is the perfect chance to do so.

So how does it work what do I need to do? Its very simple check out the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)
site and sign in with your GitHub account, then start contributing! Hmmmmm, how do I contribute? Thankfully the team at
Digital Ocean have that covered they have provided a [search](https://github.com/search?q=label:hacktoberfest+state:open+type:issue) for Github and some useful labels project maintainers can
add to issues, such as good first time and beginner friendly.

So other than providing value to OSS and getting more street cred on Github whats in it for me? A very cool T-Shirt and
an even more cool sticker to add to your laptop so you can look 1337.

**So what are you waiting for get out there ans get some PR's open!**
