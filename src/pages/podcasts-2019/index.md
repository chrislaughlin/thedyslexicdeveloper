As I mentioned in my [last post](https://www.thedyslexicdeveloper.com/A-day-in-the-life-of/) I listen to a lot of different 
podcasts on my way to and from work. I thought it would be interesting to list them out and a rough explanation of what they 
are. 

## Tech 

### [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/)

An amazing frontend focused podcast with Wes Bos and 
Scott Tolinski the focus is usually around all the aspects of front end development with a 
mix of developer lifestyle thrown in here and there. They also talk about their own hobbies outside of tech which shows a good balance.  

### [React Podcast](https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm/)

Michael Chan each episode Michael interviews someone of note in the React world. From library 
authors to the React core team. He has also branched our to tech related to React such as Gatsby and GraphQL.  

### [JS Party](https://changelog.com/jsparty)

A weekly panel podcast on everything JavaScript. There is a rough regular panel that will invite guests to discuss whats going
 on in the world of JavaScript. The cover some really good topics and have people on both sides of the debate. As their tag 
 line says "A community celebration of JavaScript and the web" they try to include all levels of the community and get many views.  

### [Front End Happy Hour](https://frontendhappyhour.com/)

I think its the concept or as I call it drinking that got me into this podcast. Covering a wide range of topics the regular 
panel have one or more quests to discuss a topic in the world of JavaScript. They also play a drinking game where a key word 
is decided at the start of the episode and each time its mentioned the panel all take a drink.    

### [The Diff](https://thediffpodcast.com/)

A really cool podcast from the open source team at facebook. Many of the episodes follow the beginning of tech that has come
 from facebook and now open sources and used my many. A really good listen if you like to know the history of the tech you 
 use.  

### [Undefined](https://undefined.fm/)

Hosted by Jared Palmer and Ken Wheeler. Listen to ths only
 to hear the back and forth between these to. Usually with a drink in them, they talk about tech mostly frontend tech. They 
 have guests on to talk a bout whatever they are working on but its usually breaks down into just random rambling.

Architecture. This make for some good dinner or drunken conversation. 

### [Something Rhymes with Purple](https://play.acast.com/s/somethingrhymeswithpurple)     

For anyone who loves to know the origin or a work this podcast is a must. Hosted by Susie Dent and Gyles Brandreth from 
countdown fame. Each week they take a topic and break down the different words surrounding it. Usually going off on a 
tangent and getting lost down a rabbit hole of words. The best part if the three words and their background at the end. Also
 giving you the perfect dinner party chat.
